This is a Graph Mamba model for pileup subtraction.

The input file is the constituent particles information of Zj process (Z > v v).

Just run python GraphMamba.py to train the model.

There are one small sample containing 10 events for both train and validation dataset and one medium sample containing 10 events for both train and validation dataset.

You can check the input information and Mamba model setting in the pileup_subtraction_note.pdf. I will keep updating the readme file in the next few days.

The model file has not been fine tuned. Please feel free to play with the model!
